## Deep Analysis of Path Resolution Issue

### Path Structure Analysis
1. **Vercel's Path Resolution**
   ```
   /vercel/path0/packages/landing/packages/landing/out/routes-manifest.json
   ```
   - Base path: `/vercel/path0/`
   - First package path: `packages/landing/`
   - Duplicated path: `packages/landing/`
   - Output directory: `out/`
   - Target file: `routes-manifest.json`

2. **Build Process Flow**
   ```bash
   1. npm ci                                 # Root installation
   2. cd packages/landing                    # Navigate to package
   3. npm ci && npm run build               # Local build
   4. Vercel looks for output               # Path resolution
   ```

3. **Configuration Layers**
   - Vercel Configuration (Limited by schema)
   - Next.js Configuration
   - Build Process Configuration
   - Directory Structure

### Root Cause Analysis

1. **Vercel Configuration Limitations**
   - Schema validation restricts available options
   - No built-in monorepo workspace support in config
   - Need to work within Vercel's constraints

2. **Path Resolution Strategy**
   - Must handle directory navigation in build command
   - Output path must be relative to project root
   - Cannot rely on workspace-aware features

3. **Build Context**
   - Build must run in package directory
   - Output must be findable from project root
   - Path resolution must be explicit

## Attempted Solutions

### Attempt 13 - Workspace Root Configuration
- **Changes Made:**
  - Added explicit `workspaceRoot` in Vercel config
  - Changed to direct directory navigation
  - Simplified output path resolution
- **Error:** Schema validation failed - invalid property 'workspaceRoot'
- **Analysis:** Vercel's configuration schema is more restrictive than documented

### Attempt 14 - Explicit Path Resolution (Current)
- **Changes Made:**
  - Removed invalid `workspaceRoot` property
  - Kept direct directory navigation
  - Using full relative path for output
  - Simplified configuration to match schema
- **Status:** In Progress
- **Reasoning:** 
  1. Working within Vercel's schema constraints
  2. Using explicit paths instead of workspace features
  3. Maintaining build context through direct navigation

## Technical Insights
1. **Vercel Configuration Constraints**
   - Limited set of valid properties
   - No built-in monorepo support in config
   - Must use project settings for advanced features

2. **Path Resolution Requirements**
   - All paths must be relative to project root
   - Directory navigation must be handled in commands
   - Output path must be explicitly specified

3. **Build Strategy**
   - Navigate to package directory first
   - Run installation and build locally
   - Output to path that Vercel can find

## Next Steps if Current Attempt Fails
1. **Project Settings Approach**
   - Configure through Vercel's UI
   - Set root directory in project settings
   - Remove vercel.json entirely

2. **Build Script Strategy**
   ```bash
   # Create build.sh
   #!/bin/bash
   cd packages/landing
   npm ci
   npm run build
   mkdir -p ../../out
   cp -r out/* ../../out/
   ```

3. **Alternative Structure**
   - Move landing to repository root
   - Keep other packages in subdirectory
   - Use standard Next.js deployment
