# Deployment Log

## Error Pattern Analysis

### Common Error Patterns
1. **Directory Navigation Issues**
   - Multiple failures with `cd packages/landing`
   - Appears in attempts 3, 6, 7, 8
   - Suggests possible workspace structure issues

2. **Package Installation Failures**
   - Both `npm install` and `npm ci` failing
   - No difference between root and package-level installation
   - Suggests possible npm configuration or permission issues

3. **Build Command Failures**
   - Build commands fail even when install seems to work
   - Consistent across different Next.js output modes
   - Suggests possible dependency or configuration conflicts

### Environment Context
- Platform: Vercel
- Build Environment: Node.js
- Project Structure: Monorepo with Turborepo
- Package Manager: npm (tried both install and ci)

## Attempted Solutions

### Attempt 8 - Separate Build Steps (Latest)
- **Changes Made:**
  - Split build command into separate steps
  - Use npm ci with verbose logging
  - Changed output directory to `packages/landing/out`
- **Error:** Command "cd packages/landing && npm ci --verbose && npm run build --verbose" exited with 1
- **Root Cause Analysis:**
  - Error occurs during the combined install and build step
  - Verbose logging enabled but error details not showing
  - Possible issue with directory access or npm cache

### Attempt 7 - Static Export
- **Changes Made:**
  - Switch to static export mode
  - Simplified build process
- **Error:** Build command failed
- **Analysis:** Similar pattern to other failures, suggesting directory access might be the core issue

### Attempt 6 - Next.js Standalone
- **Changes Made:**
  - Used standalone output
  - Modified build directory structure
- **Error:** npm install failed
- **Analysis:** Installation failing before build step, pointing to environment setup issues

[Previous attempts removed for brevity but following same pattern analysis]

## Diagnostic Steps Needed
1. **Verify Directory Structure**
   ```bash
   ls -la /vercel/path0/packages/landing
   ```

2. **Check npm Configuration**
   ```bash
   npm config list
   ```

3. **Verify Node.js Environment**
   ```bash
   node -v
   npm -v
   ```

## Next Solutions to Try
1. **Environment-First Approach**
   - Add pre-build script to verify environment
   - Log directory structure and permissions
   - Check npm cache and configuration

2. **Simplified Build Process**
   - Remove workspace complexity
   - Build directly in root directory
   - Use basic Next.js configuration

3. **Alternative Package Manager**
   - Try using pnpm or yarn
   - Test with package manager's monorepo features

4. **Build Pipeline Modification**
   - Add explicit build steps
   - Include environment preparation
   - Handle workspace linking separately
