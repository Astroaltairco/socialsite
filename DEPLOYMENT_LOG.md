# Deployment Log

## Error Pattern Analysis

### Common Error Patterns
1. **Directory Navigation Issues**
   - Multiple failures with `cd packages/landing`
   - Appears in attempts 3, 6, 7, 8, 9
   - Consistent failure pattern suggests fundamental issue with directory structure

2. **Package Installation Failures**
   - Both `npm install` and `npm ci` failing
   - No difference between root and package-level installation
   - Suggests possible npm configuration or permission issues

3. **Build Command Failures**
   - Build commands fail even with diagnostic steps
   - Fails before environment information can be logged
   - Points to possible permission or path issues in Vercel environment

4. **Output Path Resolution**
   - Vercel duplicates the package path in output directory
   - Seeing paths like `packages/landing/packages/landing/out`
   - Suggests misalignment between Next.js output and Vercel configuration

### Environment Context
- Platform: Vercel
- Build Environment: Node.js
- Project Structure: Monorepo with Turborepo
- Package Manager: npm (tried both install and ci)

## Attempted Solutions

### Attempt 11 - Workspace-Aware Build
- **Changes Made:**
  - Updated build command to use proper workspace syntax
  - Using `-w @social-staking/landing` flag
  - Keeping installation at root level
- **Error:** The file "/vercel/path0/packages/landing/packages/landing/out/routes-manifest.json" couldn't be found
- **Root Cause Analysis:**
  - Vercel is duplicating the package path in output directory
  - Next.js output directory configuration might be conflicting with Vercel's path resolution
  - Need to align Next.js and Vercel output paths

### Attempt 12 - Output Path Alignment (Current)
- **Changes Made:**
  - Updating Next.js output configuration
  - Adjusting Vercel output directory path
  - Ensuring consistent path resolution
- **Status:** In Progress
- **Reasoning:** Aligning output paths between Next.js and Vercel to prevent path duplication

## Key Insights
1. Vercel duplicates package paths in output directory
2. Next.js output configuration needs to align with Vercel's path resolution
3. Need to consider the full path from Vercel's root perspective
4. Output directory should be relative to the workspace root

## Next Steps if Current Attempt Fails
1. **Static Export Configuration**
   - Switch to `next export`
   - Use static HTML output
   - Simplify deployment process

2. **Custom Build Script**
   - Create a build script that handles path resolution
   - Manually manage output directory structure
   - Add validation steps

3. **Split Repository Strategy**
   - Move landing package to separate repo
   - Remove monorepo complexity
   - Use standard Next.js deployment
