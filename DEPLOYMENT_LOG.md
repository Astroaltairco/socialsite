# Deployment Log

## Error Pattern Analysis

### Common Error Patterns
1. **Directory Navigation Issues**
   - Multiple failures with `cd packages/landing`
   - Appears in attempts 3, 6, 7, 8, 9
   - Consistent failure pattern suggests fundamental issue with directory structure

2. **Package Installation Failures**
   - Both `npm install` and `npm ci` failing
   - No difference between root and package-level installation
   - Suggests possible npm configuration or permission issues

3. **Build Command Failures**
   - Build commands fail even with diagnostic steps
   - Fails before environment information can be logged
   - Points to possible permission or path issues in Vercel environment

4. **Workspace Script Resolution**
   - Vercel attempts to run scripts using workspace syntax
   - Direct script calls fail when not using workspace flags
   - Indicates need for proper npm workspace command structure

### Environment Context
- Platform: Vercel
- Build Environment: Node.js
- Project Structure: Monorepo with Turborepo
- Package Manager: npm (tried both install and ci)

## Attempted Solutions

### Attempt 10 - Root-Level Build (Latest)
- **Changes Made:**
  - Moved build process to root level
  - Updated package.json scripts
  - Simplified Vercel configuration
- **Error:** Missing script: "build:landing" in workspace @social-staking/landing
- **Root Cause Analysis:**
  - Vercel is trying to execute commands using workspace syntax
  - Our script was defined at root level but needed at workspace level
  - Need to use proper npm workspace command flags

### Attempt 11 - Workspace-Aware Build (Current)
- **Changes Made:**
  - Updated build command to use proper workspace syntax
  - Using `-w @social-staking/landing` flag
  - Keeping installation at root level
- **Status:** In Progress
- **Reasoning:** Aligning with npm workspace architecture and Vercel's execution model

[Previous attempts removed for brevity]

## Key Insights
1. Vercel uses npm workspaces internally
2. Commands need to be workspace-aware
3. Root-level scripts don't automatically propagate to workspaces
4. Need to use proper workspace flags for targeting specific packages

## Next Steps if Current Attempt Fails
1. **Verify Workspace Configuration**
   - Check package names and versions
   - Validate workspace definitions
   - Ensure proper package resolution

2. **Alternative Build Approaches**
   - Try using Turborepo's pipeline
   - Consider using nx instead of Turborepo
   - Explore Vercel's monorepo examples

3. **Split Repository Strategy**
   - Move landing package to separate repo
   - Deploy independently
   - Remove workspace complexity
