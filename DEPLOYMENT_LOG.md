# Deployment Log

## Current Issue
Error: Command "cd packages/landing && npm install && npm run build" exited with 1

## Attempted Solutions

### Attempt 1 - Initial Setup
- **Changes Made:**
  - Added ESLint to dependencies
  - Added memory settings to build command
  - Set output directory to `packages/landing/.next`
- **Result:** Failed with ESLint plugin error

### Attempt 2 - ESLint Fix
- **Changes Made:**
  - Moved `postcss-preset-env` to dependencies
  - Added TypeScript ESLint plugins
- **Result:** Failed with directory navigation error

### Attempt 3 - Directory Navigation
- **Changes Made:**
  - Added `cd` commands to build and install
  - Updated output directory path
- **Result:** Failed with command execution error

### Attempt 4 - Vercel Root Directory
- **Changes Made:**
  - Added `rootDirectory` configuration
  - Simplified build commands
- **Result:** Failed with schema validation error

### Attempt 5 - Root Package.json
- **Changes Made:**
  - Simplified to use root package.json
  - Removed directory navigation
  - Using npm workspaces
- **Result:** Still seeing routes manifest error

### Attempt 6 - Next.js Standalone Build
- **Changes Made:**
  - Added `output: 'standalone'` to Next.js config
  - Set explicit `basePath`
  - Updated Vercel output directory to use standalone build
  - Returned to using direct package directory navigation
- **Result:** Failed with npm install command error
- **Error Message:** Command "cd packages/landing && npm install" exited with 1

### Attempt 7 - Static Export
- **Changes Made:**
  - Switch to static export mode in Next.js
  - Update build command to include export step
  - Change output directory to static export path
  - Use simpler install command
- **Result:** Failed with build command error
- **Error Message:** Command "cd packages/landing && npm install && npm run build" exited with 1

### Attempt 8 - Separate Build Steps
- **Changes Made:**
  - Split build command into separate steps
  - Add explicit workspace setup
  - Use npm ci instead of npm install for cleaner installs
  - Add verbose logging to diagnose issues
- **Status:** In Progress
- **Reasoning:** Breaking down the build process into smaller steps will help identify where exactly the build is failing

## Next Steps to Try
1. If separate steps fail, try using Docker-based deployment
2. Consider using project references in TypeScript
3. Look into using Turborepo's remote caching
4. Try deploying just the landing package without monorepo structure
