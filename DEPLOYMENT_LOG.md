# Deployment Log

## Error Pattern Analysis

### Common Error Patterns
1. **Directory Navigation Issues**
   - Multiple failures with `cd packages/landing`
   - Appears in attempts 3, 6, 7, 8, 9
   - Consistent failure pattern suggests fundamental issue with directory structure

2. **Package Installation Failures**
   - Both `npm install` and `npm ci` failing
   - No difference between root and package-level installation
   - Suggests possible npm configuration or permission issues

3. **Build Command Failures**
   - Build commands fail even with diagnostic steps
   - Fails before environment information can be logged
   - Points to possible permission or path issues in Vercel environment

### Environment Context
- Platform: Vercel
- Build Environment: Node.js
- Project Structure: Monorepo with Turborepo
- Package Manager: npm (tried both install and ci)

## Attempted Solutions

### Attempt 9 - Environment Diagnostics (Latest)
- **Changes Made:**
  - Added environment inspection commands
  - Included directory listing and npm configuration checks
  - Attempted to gather Node.js and npm version information
- **Error:** Command "pwd && ls -la && cd packages/landing && ls -la && npm config list && node -v && npm -v && npm ci && npm run build" exited with 1
- **Root Cause Analysis:**
  - Error occurs before any diagnostic information is output
  - Suggests possible permission issues with command execution
  - May indicate Vercel environment restrictions

### Attempt 8 - Separate Build Steps
- **Changes Made:**
  - Split build command into separate steps
  - Use npm ci with verbose logging
  - Changed output directory to `packages/landing/out`
- **Error:** Command "cd packages/landing && npm ci --verbose && npm run build --verbose" exited with 1
- **Analysis:** Similar failure pattern, suggesting deeper structural issue

[Previous attempts removed for brevity]

## New Pattern Identified
- All attempts to use `cd packages/landing` fail immediately
- No diagnostic information is being output
- Suggests possible Vercel environment restrictions on directory navigation

## Next Attempt (10) - Simplified Root-Level Build
### Planned Changes:
1. Move build process to root level
2. Update package.json scripts to handle subpackage building
3. Remove directory navigation from Vercel config
4. Use relative paths in build commands

### Implementation Plan:
1. Update root package.json build script
2. Modify Next.js config to handle relative paths
3. Simplify Vercel configuration
4. Add build-time path resolution

## Future Alternatives if Attempt 10 Fails
1. **Docker-Based Approach**
   - Use custom Docker image
   - Pre-configure build environment
   - Handle directory structure in container

2. **Split Repository Approach**
   - Deploy landing package separately
   - Remove monorepo complexity for deployment

3. **Custom Build Script**
   - Create shell script for build process
   - Handle path resolution explicitly
   - Add error handling and logging
