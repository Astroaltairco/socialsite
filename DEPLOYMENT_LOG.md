# Deployment Log

## Root Cause Analysis (Updated)

### Persistent Error Patterns
1. **Directory Navigation**
   ```
   sh: line 1: cd: packages/landing: No such file or directory
   ```
   - Error occurs before repository is fully cloned
   - Directory structure not ready when commands execute
   - Navigation fails consistently across approaches

2. **Build Context**
   - Commands executing in wrong directory context
   - Repository structure not fully available
   - Timing issues with Vercel's build pipeline

3. **Configuration Complexity**
   - Multiple configuration layers (Vercel, Next.js, npm)
   - Monorepo structure adding complexity
   - Build process timing issues

## Attempted Solutions

### Attempt 16 - Custom Build Script
- **Changes Made:**
  - Created root-level build script
  - Added extensive debugging
  - Included directory verification
- **Error:** Directory navigation still failing
- **Analysis:** Script executes before repository clone completes

### Attempt 17 - Vercel Monorepo Configuration (Current)
- **Changes Made:**
  - Using Vercel's native monorepo support
  - Added `vercel.json` with project references
  - Simplified Next.js configuration
  ```json
  {
    "version": 2,
    "builds": [
      {
        "src": "packages/landing/package.json",
        "use": "@vercel/next"
      }
    ]
  }
  ```
- **Status:** In Progress
- **Reasoning:**
  1. Let Vercel handle monorepo structure
  2. Use official Next.js builder
  3. Avoid manual directory navigation

## Technical Analysis

### Build Pipeline Sequence
1. **Vercel's Process**
   ```
   1. Initialize build environment
   2. Clone repository
   3. Execute build commands
   4. Process vercel.json
   5. Run framework-specific builders
   ```

2. **Timing Issues**
   - Custom commands run too early
   - Need to let Vercel handle directory structure
   - Framework builders run after repository setup

3. **Configuration Hierarchy**
   ```
   vercel.json (top level)
   └── @vercel/next builder
       └── next.config.js
           └── package.json
   ```

## Key Insights
1. **Build Process**
   - Manual navigation is unreliable
   - Need to use Vercel's built-in tools
   - Framework-specific builders are more reliable

2. **Monorepo Handling**
   - Vercel has native monorepo support
   - Project references are preferred
   - Build commands should be framework-specific

3. **Configuration Strategy**
   - Minimize custom scripts
   - Use official builders
   - Let Vercel handle directory structure

## Next Steps if Current Attempt Fails

### Option 1: Project Settings Override
```json
{
  "version": 2,
  "builds": [
    {
      "src": "packages/landing/package.json",
      "use": "@vercel/next",
      "config": {
        "installCommand": "npm install",
        "buildCommand": "npm run build"
      }
    }
  ]
}
```

### Option 2: Framework-Specific Configuration
1. Remove custom build scripts
2. Use Next.js specific settings
3. Configure through Vercel UI

### Option 3: Repository Restructure
1. Move landing to separate repository
2. Use standard Next.js deployment
3. Link packages through npm

## Monitoring Points
1. **Build Logs**
   - Watch for builder selection
   - Monitor repository clone
   - Check directory structure

2. **Configuration**
   - Verify vercel.json processing
   - Check builder configuration
   - Monitor framework detection

3. **Output**
   - Verify build artifacts
   - Check deployment paths
   - Monitor routing setup
